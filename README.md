# Food Web Simulator
## Overview

The Food Web Simulator is a Python-based graphical tool that allows users to simulate and interact with ecological food webs. Users can create nodes representing species, add relationships between them, and simulate population changes over time. The project is built using pygame and modular components for flexibility and scalability.

## Features

1. **Node Interaction** : Add, edit, delete nodes representing species in the ecosystem.

2. **Relationship Visualization**: Draw connections between nodes to represent predator-prey relationships.

3. **Simulation** : Step through days to observe changes in population values.

4. **Graphical User Interface** : Intuitive interface built using pygame for easy interaction.

5. **Animations** : Smooth transitions and menu animations.

## Requirements
Make sure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pygame

To install pygame, run:
```bash 
pip install pygame 
```

## How to Use

### Main Menu

- Start the simulation from the main menu by selecting Start.

- Exit the application by choosing Exit.

### Node Management

- **Add Node** : Click the "Add" button, then click anywhere on the canvas to create a new node.

- **Edit Node** : Click the "Edit" button, then select a node to update its name, population, or other attributes.

- **Delete Node** : Click the "Delete" button, then select a node to remove it.

### Simulation Controls

- **Day Progression** : Use the "Start Day" button to advance the simulation by one day. Observe how populations change based on predefined rules.

- **Pause/Reset** : Reset the simulation to its initial state or pause ongoing actions.

### Visualization

- Drag nodes to reposition them for better visualization.

- Connections between nodes represent ecological relationships (e.g., predator-prey interactions).
